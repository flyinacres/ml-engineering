Had to put kaggle.json in /Users/rff/.kaggle
Should have checked ahead of time--I had old tokens from February
Created new token here: https://www.kaggle.com/settings, which expires the old tokesn
and automatically downloads.

Put it in the right location with the right name,
and the code ran.

It did respond with a number of error messages, but still seems to be successful
