# Notes on creating the conda environment
# I had to use sudo to get this to work.  Otherwise it complains that the 
# .yml file is an invalid argument...
sudo conda env create -f myfile.yml


# To activate this env:
#     conda activate mlewp-chapter01-hotfix
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     conda deactivate
#
# To list envs
#     conda env list
